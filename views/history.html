									<p>A long time ago, in a village far, far away, there was a young boy named Jonas... He had really good parents and one big brother. Together they lived in a nice house with a big garden. One day, the parents of Jonas bought a computer because Jonas really wanted a computer! They had no internet connection so the only thing Jonas could do was drawing stuff in Paint. Jonas liked to tell his mom that he was surfing on the internet, he just opened Notepad and started typing random things. His mom always answered on a funny way: "Don't you dare!". Jonas kept doing this because he liked her reaction.

							
								
									<P>A couple of years later, they got internet connection and Jonas liked to play games on Minigames.com. One day the uncle of Jonas came to their house, he came because Jonas asked him to put Windows XP on the computer that was still running on Windows 98. Jonas wanted to see how this worked and was watching the screen the whole day. He was so happy with the new Windows XP because it looked so fancy! This old pc was getting slow and Jonas really wanted a new computer. He asked his parents and they told him that he had to get a good score on school. So he really did his best because he wanted the computer. [More coming soon] 	</P>
						
							<!--		<P>From the time I was a young boy, computers already interested me. I always was sitting next to the people who fixed it. An0d I always thought. Hmm.. this is easy! Getting older I got the feeling that I was really good with computers. I fixed all the computers of my friends, and they where all happy with the result. No virus was a problem for me!
										<span>So I started to like this, and then I saw this school where I could get 11 hours of IT in a week. My mouth was watering and I really wanted to go there. So I did and there I started to learn programming in Visual Basic and how to fix hardware in a computer. I learned so much from this, and I passed in my 5th year. The next year I went to an other school in Hasselt because they also got a little Design class.</span>
